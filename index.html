                        While there is no specific timeline when Blackjack started, researchers have reasons to believe
                        that it began in French casinos around the 18th century. Blackjack has few other names,
                        but the French called it Vingt-et-Un, translated it means twenty-one. Blackjack was also
                        commonly
                        called twenty-one by the English.

                    <li>

                        Others believe the game first originated during the Roman era,
                        for which wooden blocks were utilised to denote the numbers involved,
                        however this is not confirmed.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li>

                        It's to be said the way Blackjack got its name, is casinos offered bonus payouts
                        to stimulate players' interest. The bonus was a ten-to-one payout if player's were
                        dealt the Ace of Spades and a black jack. This hand was called "Blackjack".
                        The name stuck with it even after they got rid of the bonuses.
